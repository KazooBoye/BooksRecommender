## Project description
- This project is part of a Machine Learning and Data Mining course
- This project aims at the technicallity of data preprocess and model architecture

## File structure
- The project should have only ONE README.md file and a single DevLog.md file for looging development process, bugfixes and features added.
- The project should have a folder named `data` containing all datasets used in the project. This folder should be further divided into `raw` and `processed` subfolders
- The project should have a folder named `notebooks` containing all Jupyter notebooks used for reporting and experimentation
- The project should have a folder named `src` containing all source code and script files
- The project should have a folder named `models` containing all saved models and model checkpoints
- The project should have a folder named `results` containing all results, plots and visualizations
- The project should have a folder named `configs` containing all configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) for hyperparameters and settings

## Coding styles
- DO NOT use emojis anywhere in the code or documentation
- When implementing a new method or function, overwrite the existing one if it exists instead of creating a new one to avoid redundancy and explosion of codebase

## Environment
- The project should have a `requirements.txt` file listing all Python dependencies and their versions
- The project use a conda environment called 'mlenv' with Python 3.12.5
- The project should have a `environment.yml` file for setting up the conda environment
